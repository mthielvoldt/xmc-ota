# Purpose

This example interface is provided as a starting point for you to build your own web-UI for your embedded project.
It is a basic static site using react and puts all the protocol wigits into an unordered list on the front page. 
The example will have served its purpose once you understand one way the wigits can be incorporated into the UI.  

# Scaffolding

This example ui was scaffolded by running  
```npm create vite@latest example-web-ui -- --template react-ts```

This template includes a recommendation to enable type-aware lint rules for production applicaitons.
