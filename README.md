# An XMC4700 remote FW Update using wolfBoot

## Learnings

### About Wolfboot
- WolfBoot is built with the expectation that you modify the code.  For example, if using your own HAL for an arm chip, and Cmake, you're exepected to:
  - write your .c and .ld files in the <wolfboot_root>/hal dir.
  - add your target name to the list of options in wolfBoot/CMakeLists.txt
  - modify test-app/startup_arm.c to provide your chip's vector table.

- Wolfboot uses the same startup file for all ARM chips ðŸ¤”. Not sure how this works: the startup file includes the vector table, which is definitely MCU specific. See wolfBoot/test-app/CMakeLists.
- WolfBoot seems to have a number of issues with cmake support.  Seems like cmake use is still quite unstable.  Examples on github use make. 
- build will fail at the `Building signing tool` step if you don't first run, `make keytools` from the wolfboot root dir. 

#### Deps needed for WolfBoot usage
- needed `pip install wolfcrypt` for "Generating keystore.c and signing private key" build step. 
- libtool for needed to `pip install wolfcrypt`

### About Chip MFGs
- Flash program memory and the way you write it varies significantly chip to chip.
- Infineon uses an uncommon convention describing flash memory state: 
  Infineon: Programmed = "1"  Erased = "0".  
  Others: Programmed = "0", Erased = "1"

### About Hardware
- Some MFGs have cache mechanisms for memory access.  These only serve to accelerate flash read-access.  It'll have two base-addresses for the same physical flash.  The two base addresses are essentially parallel access paths to the same memory, with one going through the cache HW, the other bypassing it.  All writes (erase, program) to flash will use the cache-bypass (non-cached) address.
- A flash cell (bit) that is already in the programmed state (Infineon 1) can be written to with the erased-state (Infineon 0) over and over without disturbing the original state. 

### About Linker and Startup code
- Some MFGs use c for startup files (ST).  Others use .S files - assembly code that passes through the c preprocessor first.  (Infineon).
- If you're looking at assembly, and see a label you don't recognize, it might be defined below in the same file (assembly essentially works like "hoisting")
